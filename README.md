# CarPos

It is a real simple way to track gps position on a map. 
Leaflet with openstreetmap are used for the map, and the interesting thing is that the position data are not stored on a server, but in the client's browser localstorage. 

The language is javascript. 
I have chosen the two license that I like more, but if you want to suggest other licenses or, features, please feel free to do it! 

TIA for your attention.
